#                                 Say Hello! The Green Energy Economy is Here!

# P2P Distributed Green Energy Market
- Empowering communities... Produce, consume and sell green energy locally and efficiently.

- Energy Cooperatives... The link between communities and the real electricity market.

# METRON 

Trust, Transparency and Traceability.

Certify who, when and where produces and consumes each kWh of green energy within Pylon Network.

- Why METRON?

To have free access to the data that the current energy system does not offer.

- What is METRON?

METRON is the smart energy meter developed by Klenergy, which gives you access to the Pylon Network datalayer. It is based on blockchain technology and integrates its own digital payment method, the Pylon Coin, which allows you to trace / know the origin of your energy – .

- What does METRON offer?

P2P transactions – traceability of electricity
Full transparency and full privacy.
Energy efficiency – saving up to 30% of electricity.
Instantaneous payment method for green energy. 
Full flexibility and adoptability to the needs of any regional/national/international markets.
Open-source software to accommodate cooperation between all players and faster product development.

- What role does METRON have within the Pylon Network?

The METRON are participants of the Pylon network, which means that all them contribute in the audit of the P2P transactions, creating an electricity and payments transactions database totally decentralized and totally transparent.

- METRON models:

We offer two models of Klenergy METRON which allow it to be applicable in all markets and regulations:

METRON.Home , Smart meter – is a replacement for the existing utility meter.

METRON.Plus , Behind the meter – is a behind-the-meter version (in case the meter replacement is not allowed).
  

# Pylon Network Blockchain

First and unique Blockchain dessigned for energy sector needs.

![N|](https://pylon-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Imagen_layers.png)

All blockchain platforms do not work for any application. The energy sector in particular requires a high rate of transaction speed to manage all his data; In addition, it is necessary to have great scalability and versatility, being able to absorb huge amounts of data, store and process them. For the moment, blockchains like Ethereum, could not cover these requirements.

The value proposition of Pylon Network is the development of its own blockchain technology specially designed for the energy market needs.

# Pylon Token

- What is PYLON TOKEN?

The Pylon Token or abbreviated “PYLNT” represents the property of the renewable facilities associated with the Pylon Network project.

Through this form of ownership, the owners of Pylon Tokens receive the dividends generated by the renewable facilities financed. The dividend allocation process will begin at a later stage (after commercialization – end 2018).

New users who want to join the Pylon Network platform, should acquire a small amount of PYLNT, as a membership fee – which they will need to hold for as long as they are in the platform. If at any time they wish to leave the platform, they will be free to decide on if /when they want to sell their PYLNT to new users who want to join Pylon Network.

More information and a fully detailed explanation will follow shortly – during the development of Pylon Network within the Spanish network / market, in collaboration with GoiEner.First and unique Blockchain dessigned for energy sector needs.

# Pylon Coin

- What is PYLON COIN?

Pylon Coin or abbreviated “PYLNC” is the payment and certification method of green energy used by all the players within Pylon Network – Consumers, Producers, Prosumers, Renewable Energy Cooperatives.

- What does PYLON COIN represent?

It represents an indestructible and inherent certificate of green energy, since Pylon Coin is “generated” through the use of renewable electricity and combined with the transparency of blockchain technology.

- What are the advantages of using PYLON COINS?

By using this payment and trace system, users will be able to:

Know – Who-When-Where – has consumed or produced each kWh of electricity.
Micro-payments in real time.
Secure transactions, fast and without intermediaries.
Traceability and transparency of all operations.
Accounting processes optimization of the energy cooperatives.
How you are going to pay less for the energy you consume with Pylon-coins?
The way to get cheaper energy will be using PPA (Power Purchase Agreements) with green energy producers. A PPA is a long-term power purchase agreement with the producer. The cooperative will close PPAs with producers gradually.

- How does PYLON COIN works?

Pylon Coin is the most sustainable cryptographic currency in the world. The “CORE” of the Pylon Coin is based on the proof of cooperation between all the participants, reducing the energy validation costs of the transactions. It is the first blockchain algorithm developed specifically for the energy sector needs by the Pylon team and its partners, and uses only 100% renewable electricity for its operation.
